# Project Summary
This program allows a user to see visitor/foot traffic of Michigan's Book Stores, Museums, Baked Goods Stores, and Retail Bakeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, since calls for social-distancing began to make their way in Michigan (Dec-Present). Users will be able to view foot traffic in a Flask App that allows them to filter by City and Business Industry, as well as to sort by a specific month's visits. They can view their results in either an HTML table, or a Plotly graph. 

This program also allows users to see the most frequently used words for tweets that contain #COVID19. The information will be presented to them as a Word Cloud on a page of the Flask App.
